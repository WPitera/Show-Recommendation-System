## Overview

This project is an end-to-end Anime Recommendation System that leverages data from the MyAnimeList API to fetch anime rankings. It then preprocesses and cleans the data, uses a Gemini language model API to simplify anime titles, and computes text-based similarities using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Finally, an interactive Gradio interface allows users to select their favorite anime and receive recommendations based on their selections.

---

## Features

- **Data Acquisition:**  
  Fetches anime ranking data from the MyAnimeList API using a provided client ID.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Processes the raw JSON data into a structured pandas DataFrame including fields such as title, synopsis, genres, mean score, media type, and status.

- **Title Cleaning with Gemini:**  
  Utilizes the Gemini API (via the `langchain_google_genai` package) to simplify anime titles by removing season numbers and special identifiers.

- **Textual Feature Combination:**  
  Merges multiple text fields (titles, alternative titles, synopsis, genres, etc.) into a single string for each anime to serve as input for vectorization.

- **Similarity Computation:**  
  Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate a similarity matrix that underpins the recommendation engine.

- **Recommendation Engine:**  
  Suggests similar anime based on user-selected favorites from the list.

- **Interactive Interface:**  
  Built with Gradio, enabling users to add anime to a personal list, clear the list, and fetch recommendations with the click of a button.
  
- **Cosine Similarity**
  In an inner product space containing two non-zero vectors, cosine similarity serves as a way of determining the similarity of the two vectors
  Cosine similarity is found by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing by the product of their magnitudes

- **Embedding**
 Machine Learning and AI models can be integrated into an application or a device, which enables the software to complete jobs such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making while bypassing the need for an external server for processing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Python Packages:**
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `gradio`
  - `langchain_google_genai`

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WPitera/Show-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Show-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   If a `requirements.txt` file exists, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, install manually:

   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas scikit-learn gradio langchain_google_genai
   ```

4. **API Credentials:**

   - **MyAnimeList API:** Replace the `CLIENT_ID` in the code with your valid MyAnimeList client ID.
   - **Gemini API:** Replace the `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook or Python Script:**

   You can run the provided code either in a Jupyter Notebook environment or as a standalone Python script. Ensure the following snippet is executed when running as a script:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       demo.launch()
   ```

2. **Using the Gradio Interface:**

   - The interface displays a dropdown populated with anime titles fetched and processed from MyAnimeList.
   - **Add to List:** Select an anime from the dropdown and click the "Add to List" button to add it to your personal list.
   - **Clear List:** Use the "Clear List" button to reset your selections.
   - **Get Recommendations:** Once you have your favorite anime in the list, click "Get Recommendations" to see similar anime suggestions.

3. **Recommendation Engine Details:**

   The recommendation function computes cosine similarity based on combined text fields (title, synopsis, genres, etc.) to find and suggest anime that are most similar to the userâ€™s favorites.

## Data and APIs

### Data Source

- **MyAnimeList API:**  
  The system fetches anime ranking data from the endpoint:  
  `https://api.myanimelist.net/v2/anime/ranking`  
  The data includes fields such as `id`, `title`, `synopsis`, `genres`, `mean`, `media_type`, and `status`.

### External APIs

- **Gemini (via langchain_google_genai):**  
  The Gemini API is used to simplify and clean anime titles by removing extraneous identifiers such as season numbers, "Movie", "Special", and "OVA". This helps in creating a uniform title for better matching.

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

1. **Data Fetching and Preprocessing:**
   - `fetch_anime_list(offset)`: Retrieves anime ranking data from MyAnimeList in batches.
   - `preprocess_data(anime_list, existing_df)`: Converts raw API responses into a pandas DataFrame, merging with existing data if needed.

2. **Title Cleaning:**
   - `extract_base_title_with_gemini(title)`: Uses the Gemini API to simplify titles. The code iterates over the DataFrame to update the titles.

3. **Combining Data Copies:**
   - `combine_copies(new_data)`: Groups and aggregates data by title, combining multiple entries to remove duplicates and aggregate information such as alternative titles, synopsis, and genres.

4. **Similarity Computation:**
   - `compute_similarity(df)`: Combines various text fields into a single column, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and computes a cosine similarity matrix for the anime dataset.

5. **Recommendation Engine:**
   - `recommend_anime(user_favorites, df, similarity_matrix)`: Finds similar anime by checking the similarity matrix for each user favorite.

6. **Interactive Gradio UI:**
   - Built with Gradio Blocks, the UI provides dropdowns, buttons, and text boxes to add anime to a list, display the list, and output recommendations interactively.

### Dependencies and Libraries

- **requests:** For API calls to MyAnimeList.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and DataFrame operations.
- **scikit-learn:** For TF-IDF vectorization and computing cosine similarity.
- **gradio:** For building the interactive web UI.
- **langchain_google_genai:** For interfacing with the Gemini API to process anime titles.

## Future Work

- **Performance Improvements:**  
  Optimize data fetching and processing for larger datasets.

- **Enhanced Recommendation Algorithms:**  
  Incorporate collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation methods to refine suggestions.

- **UI Enhancements:**  
  Expand the Gradio interface to include additional filters and richer visualizations.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**  
  Improve error management for API calls and provide detailed logging for debugging.
  
- **Gemini:**
  Find an alternative method for using Gemini that does not require premium key or manual intervention
